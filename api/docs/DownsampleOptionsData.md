## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**DownsampleImages** | **bool** | Gets or sets specifies whether images should be downsampled. | [optional] [default to null]
**Resolution** | **int32** | Gets or sets specifies the resolution in pixels per inch which the images should be downsampled to. | [optional] [default to null]
**ResolutionThreshold** | **int32** | Gets or sets specifies the threshold resolution in pixels per inch. If resolution of an image in the document is less than threshold value, the downsampling algorithm will not be applied. A value of 0 means the threshold check is not used and all images that can be reduced in size are downsampled. | [optional] [default to null]
